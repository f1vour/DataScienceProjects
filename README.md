# DataScienceProjects
A collection of Python and Data Science projects developed during my internship learning journey with Flexisaf. These projects give a beginners view into data science, reinforcing my understanding of programming logic, libraries used for data science, AI, ML and problem-solving. Excited to keep learning and improving!
